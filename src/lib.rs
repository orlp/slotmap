//! # slotmap
//!
//! This library provides a container with persistent unique keys to access
//! stored values, [`SlotMap`]. Upon insertion a key is returned that can be
//! used to later access or remove the values. Insertion, removal and access all
//! take O(1) time with low overhead. Great for storing collections of objects
//! that need stable, safe references but have no clear ownership otherwise,
//! such as game entities or graph nodes.
//!
//! The difference between a [`BTreeMap`] or [`HashMap`] and a slot map is
//! that the slot map generates and returns the key when inserting a value. A
//! key is always unique and will only refer to the value that was inserted.
//! A slot map's main purpose is to simply own things in a safe and efficient
//! manner.
//!
//! You can also create (multiple) secondary maps that can map the keys returned
//! by [`SlotMap`] to other values, to associate arbitrary data with objects
//! stored in slot maps, without hashing required - it's direct indexing under
//! the hood.
//!
//! The minimum required stable Rust version for this crate is 1.49.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # use slotmap::*;
//! let mut sm = SlotMap::new();
//! let foo = sm.insert("foo");  // Key generated on insert.
//! let bar = sm.insert("bar");
//! assert_eq!(sm[foo], "foo");
//! assert_eq!(sm[bar], "bar");
//!
//! sm.remove(bar);
//! let reuse = sm.insert("reuse");  // Space from bar reused.
//! assert_eq!(sm.contains_key(bar), false);  // After deletion a key stays invalid.
//!
//! let mut sec = SecondaryMap::new();
//! sec.insert(foo, "noun");  // We provide the key for secondary maps.
//! sec.insert(reuse, "verb");
//!
//! for (key, val) in sm {
//!     println!("{} is a {}", val, sec[key]);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Serialization through [`serde`], [`no_std`] support and unstable features
//!
//! Both keys and the slot maps have full (de)seralization support through
//! the [`serde`] library. A key remains valid for a slot map even after one or
//! both have been serialized and deserialized! This makes storing or
//! transferring complicated referential structures and graphs a breeze. Care has
//! been taken such that deserializing keys and slot maps from untrusted sources
//! is safe. If you wish to use these features you must enable the `serde`
//! feature flag for `slotmap` in your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! ```text
//! slotmap = { version = "1.0", features = ["serde"] }
//! ```
//!
//! This crate also supports [`no_std`] environments, but does require the
//! [`alloc`] crate to be available. To enable this you have to disable the
//! `std` feature that is enabled by default:
//!
//! ```text
//! slotmap = { version = "1.0", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! Unfortunately [`SparseSecondaryMap`] is not available in [`no_std`], because
//! it relies on [`HashMap`]. Finally the `unstable` feature can be defined to
//! enable the parts of `slotmap` that only work on nightly Rust.
//!
//! # Why not index a [`Vec`], or use [`slab`], [`stable-vec`], etc?
//!
//! Those solutions either can not reclaim memory from deleted elements or
//! suffer from the ABA problem. The keys returned by `slotmap` are versioned.
//! This means that once a key is removed, it stays removed, even if the
//! physical storage inside the slotmap is reused for new elements. The key is a
//! permanently unique<sup>*</sup> reference to the inserted value. Despite
//! supporting versioning, a [`SlotMap`] is often not (much) slower than the
//! alternative, by internally using carefully checked unsafe code. Finally,
//! `slotmap` simply has a lot of features that make your life easy.
//!
//! # Performance characteristics and implementation details
//!
//! Insertion, access and deletion is all O(1) with low overhead by storing the
//! elements inside a [`Vec`]. Unlike references or indices into a vector,
//! unless you remove a key it is never invalidated. Behind the scenes each
//! slot in the vector is a `(value, version)` tuple. After insertion the
//! returned key also contains a version. Only when the stored version and
//! version in a key match is a key valid. This allows us to reuse space in the
//! vector after deletion without letting removed keys point to spurious new
//! elements. <sup>*</sup>After 2<sup>31</sup> deletions and insertions to the
//! same underlying slot the version wraps around and such a spurious reference
//! could potentially occur. It is incredibly unlikely however, and in all
//! circumstances is the behavior safe. A slot map can hold up to
//! 2<sup>32</sup> - 2 elements at a time.
//!
//! The memory usage for each slot in [`SlotMap`] is `4 + max(sizeof(T), 4)`
//! rounded up to the alignment of `T`. Similarly it is `4 + max(sizeof(T), 12)`
//! for [`HopSlotMap`]. [`DenseSlotMap`] has an overhead of 8 bytes per element
//! and 8 bytes per slot.
//!
//! # Choosing [`SlotMap`], [`HopSlotMap`] or [`DenseSlotMap`]
//!
//! A [`SlotMap`] is the fastest for most operations, except iteration. It can
//! never shrink the size of its underlying storage, because it must remember
//! for each storage slot what the latest stored version was, even if the slot
//! is empty now. This means that iteration can be slow as it must iterate over
//! potentially a lot of empty slots.
//!
//! [`HopSlotMap`] solves this by maintaining more information on
//! insertion/removal, allowing it to iterate only over filled slots by 'hopping
//! over' contiguous blocks of vacant slots. This can give it significantly
//! better iteration speed.  If you expect to iterate over all elements in a
//! [`SlotMap`] a lot, and potentially have a lot of deleted elements, choose
//! [`HopSlotMap`]. The downside is that insertion and removal is roughly twice
//! as slow. Random access is the same speed for both.
//!
//! [`DenseSlotMap`] goes even further and stores all elements on a contiguous
//! block of memory. It uses two indirections per random access; the slots
//! contain indices used to access the contiguous memory. This means random
//! access is slower than both [`SlotMap`] and [`HopSlotMap`], but iteration is
//! significantly faster, as fast as a normal [`Vec`].
//!
//! # Choosing [`SecondaryMap`] or [`SparseSecondaryMap`]
//!
//! You want to associate extra data with objects stored in a slot map, so you
//! use (multiple) secondary maps to map keys to that data.
//!
//! A [`SecondaryMap`] is simply a [`Vec`] of slots like slot map is, and
//! essentially provides all the same guarantees as [`SlotMap`] does for its
//! operations (with the exception that you provide the keys as produced by the
//! primary slot map). This does mean that even if you associate data to only
//! a single element from the primary slot map, you could need and have to
//! initialize as much memory as the original.
//!
//! A [`SparseSecondaryMap`] is like a [`HashMap`] from keys to objects, however
//! it automatically removes outdated keys for slots that had their space
//! reused. You should use this variant if you expect to store some associated
//! data for only a small portion of the primary slot map.
//!
//! # Custom key types
//!
//! If you have multiple slot maps it's an error to use the key of one slot map
//! on another slot map. The result is safe, but unspecified, and can not be
//! detected at runtime, so it can lead to a hard to find bug.
//!
//! To prevent this, slot maps allow you to specify what the type is of the key
//! they return. You can construct new key types using the [`new_key_type!`]
//! macro. The resulting type behaves exactly like [`DefaultKey`], but is a
//! distinct type. So instead of simply using `SlotMap<DefaultKey, Player>` you
//! would use:
//!
//! ```
//! # use slotmap::*;
//! # #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
//! # struct Player;
//! new_key_type! { struct PlayerKey; }
//! let sm: SlotMap<PlayerKey, Player> = SlotMap::with_key();
//! ```
//!
//! You can write code generic over any key type using the [`Key`] trait.
